[NFT Smart Contract - Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xa5f2ba0fFf428A9913FA5B8aC6f93B44e13A653b#code)

[View Collection - Testnet Opensea Collection](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/squarenft-n4krdfqrby)

This project is built following the Buildspace Projects NFT Collection guide provided by [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Programmatically generate your own NFT collection, write + deploy a smart contract in Solidity, and build your own React dApp to let friends connect their wallets and interact w/ your NFTs by joining a cohort today.
